# Analysis-of-percipitation-data-with-R
For this project I used precipitation data for the state of Maine covering a 30-year time period from 1991 to 2020.  The data was collected by the Midwestern Regional Climate Center located at Purdue University and is available free to the public via the MRCCâ€™s cli-MATE database.  The data set consists of the monthly mean precipitation for each month from January 1991 to December 2020, as well as a column of data containing the annual precipitation per year.
